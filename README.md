# Kajal_8972108_Assignment04_MAT

This repository contains the code and tests for **Assignment 04** of the MAT course. The project involves calculating various aspects of painting, including canvas size, paint requirements, cost, time, and more. Each folder represents a separate functionality with its corresponding TypeScript function and test file.

## Project Structure

The project is organized into the following folders, each containing a `.ts` file with the functionality and a corresponding `.test.ts` file with unit tests:

- `calculateCanvasDiagonal/`
  - `calculateCanvasDiagonal.ts` - Function to calculate the diagonal of a canvas based on its width and height.
  - `calculateCanvasDiagonal.test.ts` - Unit tests for `calculateCanvasDiagonal.ts`.

- `calculateCanvasPerimeter/`
  - `calculateCanvasPerimeter.ts` - Function to calculate the perimeter of a canvas.
  - `calculateCanvasPerimeter.test.ts` - Unit tests for `calculateCanvasPerimeter.ts`.

- `calculateCanvasSize/`
  - `calculateCanvasSize.ts` - Function to calculate the area of a canvas.
  - `calculateCanvasSize.test.ts` - Unit tests for `calculateCanvasSize.ts`.

- `calculatePaintCost/`
  - `calculatePaintCost.ts` - Function to calculate the cost of paint required to cover a canvas area.
  - `calculatePaintCost.test.ts` - Unit tests for `calculatePaintCost.ts`.

- `calculateTotalCost/`
  - `calculateTotalCost.ts` - Function to calculate the total cost, including paint and labor.
  - `calculateTotalCost.test.ts` - Unit tests for `calculateTotalCost.ts`.

- `convertAreaToSquareFeet/`
  - `convertAreaToSquareFeet.ts` - Function to convert area measurements to square feet.
  - `convertAreaToSquareFeet.test.ts` - Unit tests for `convertAreaToSquareFeet.ts`.

- `estimatePaintingTime/`
  - `estimatePaintingTime.ts` - Function to estimate the time required to paint a canvas based on area and painting speed.
  - `estimatePaintingTime.test.ts` - Unit tests for `estimatePaintingTime.ts`.

- `paintRequiredCalculator/`
  - `paintRequiredCalculator.ts` - Function to calculate the amount of paint required based on area and coverage per liter.
  - `paintRequiredCalculator.test.ts` - Unit tests for `paintRequiredCalculator.ts`.

- `paintRequiredForMultipleCoats/`
  - `paintRequiredForMultipleCoats.ts` - Function to calculate the paint required for multiple coats of paint.
  - `paintRequiredForMultipleCoats.test.ts` - Unit tests for `paintRequiredForMultipleCoats.ts`.

- `main.ts` - The main script that runs the various calculations using the above functions.
